1-Sequence container:- Data is stored in a linear sequence
    1- Array:- Memory is contiguous and fixed
    2-Vector:- Dynamic array Memory is contiguous
    3- Deque:- Doubly ended queue it can expand and contract from both front and rear{it's mem. is complex can read it}
    4- Forward List:- Singly LL mem. not contiguous
    5- List:- Doubly LL mem. not contiguous

2- Associative Containers:- Use the tree like structure to store the data and the data is ordered
    1-Set:- Unique elements are stored. and ordered(sorted manner)(it uses a BST like structure  to store value)
    2-Multiset:- Can also store duplicate element.
    3-Map:- Used to store a collection of (Key,value) pair data is stored orderly as per key value(it uses a BST like structure  to store value)
    4-Multimap:- One key can have multiple values

3-Unordered Associative Containers:- If you don't want data to be stored in a sorted fashion.
    1-Unordered Set:- 
    2-Unordered Multiset:-
    3-Unordered Map:- It's like a Hash table.
    4-Unordered Multimap:-

4- Container Adapter:- 
    1-Stack:-
    2-Queue:-
    3-Priority Queue:- Heap data structure only name looks like queue.
